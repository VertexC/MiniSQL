DONE:

make the buffer manager work
1. use the STL to make hashtable work. Remeber to provide hash function on
our own in declaration as well as iterator declartion.
2. slot has to be initialized after finding it with iterator.
3. a block has to be unpinned after use
--4. minor bug, the prev of a pinned block won't update (solved, doubly linked list problem)
-----------------------

make the block filehandle work
make the block block manager work
1. add back flush all blocks
2. how to actually transform from a FILE* to a int(use some function or just (int)) remains a problem
if a simple cast is not enough, we will try anthor way
3. in openfile, change wb+ --> ab+, for if it is write, then the old content is cleaned when opened.
-----------------------
TODO:
make the record manager work

make record filehandle

filescan

6/17
in filescan, we need to find some ways to get next record  -- done

changes char *& to replace char** in bufmanager

get bugs.. seems forget to initialize
6/18
add initialization in RM_filehandle ctor
minor bugs fixex. in write block: !fseek -> fseek (0 is normal)
6/19
fix a bug in BF_FileHandle, buggy error checking at line 48, return 0 is normal
fix a bug in RM_FileHandle, have to pass by reference in inline int RM_FileHandle::getBitmapAndBlockHdr
fix a bug in RM_Record, when set record forget to allocate new memory while the data is NULL at first
it is working now!
6/21
to support for Dev-C++, instead of using (int)file, use fileno function
6/23
change readBlock in BF_bufferManager, return value of fseek 0 is OK, so wrong error checking
6/29
bug caused by destructed twice in RM_Manager, the BF_Manager in it should be
a reference instead of a solid member, otherwise it will be destructed twice
(first when RM_Manager is destructed, then itself)
